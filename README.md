# Life Calendar

The inspiration for this project comes from a poster I used to keep in my room. It consisted of a grid of squares roughly 1 inch by 1 inch in size. Each square represents a week of life lived. Each row represents a year of life lived, and so, there are 52 columns (52 weeks in a year).

In the process of moving to a new house, the orignal poster was lost. Instead of buying a new one and tediously filling in each square once again, creating a program that does it for me and provides live updates, I thought, would be really cool.

Based off a fixed birthday, the program does the rest and calculates number of days, weeks, and years alive and displays this information on a webpage all using ReactJS.
